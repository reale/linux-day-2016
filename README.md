# The Unbearable Lightness: Extending the Bash shell

These slides were written for my talk at the [Linux Day 2016](http://ld16.lugroma3.org/) in Rome.  They start with an overview of the intrinsic weaknesses that make so hard to design and implement a fully-fledged, general-purpose Bash library *in Bash*.

Then comes bird's eye survey of some outstanding *specimina* among the existing libraries, not without the occasional fragment of code.

Finally a working example is introduced: the [bashlets](https://github.com/bashlets/) library, a novel, work-in-progress modular extensible toolbox for Bash.
